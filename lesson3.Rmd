This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
surveys <- read_csv('data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv')
```

```{r}
surveys_no_na <- surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight),
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),
         !is.na(sex))
head(surveys_no_na)
```

```{r}
species_counts <- surveys_no_na %>% 
  count(species_id) %>% 
  filter(n >= 50)
head(species_counts)
```

```{r}
surveys_complete <- surveys_no_na %>% 
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

Now, we're ready to make some graphs!

GGPLOT uses the basic template:
`ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight,
                     y = hindfoot_length))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight,
                     y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight,
                     y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight,
                     y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, colour = "blue")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight,
                     y = hindfoot_length,
                     color = species_id)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```
