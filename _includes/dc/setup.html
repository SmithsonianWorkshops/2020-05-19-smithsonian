<h3 id='spreadsheet'>Spreadsheet Installation</h3>
<p>You will need a spreadsheet program (like Microsoft Excel) for the 
  <a href='https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/'>Data Organization in Spreadsheets</a> lesson.</p>
<p>If you do not have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer, you can use the Smithsonian-provided 
Office 365, available through <a href='https://telework.si.edu/'>telework.si.edu</a>. You can also use Google Sheets, if 
you are more familiar with that interface.</p>
<h3 id='openrefine'>OpenRefine Installation</h3>
<p>Please install OpenRefine 3.4 beta from <a href='http://openrefine.org/download.html'>http://openrefine.org/download.html</a>. If you
 have a Windows computer, choose "Windows kit with embedded Java". If you have a Mac computer, the only version provided does not 
 require Java.</p>
<p>If you are not able to install OpenRefine on your computer for any reason, we have a browser-based installation available at <a href='https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SmithsonianWorkshops/binders/open_refine'>https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SmithsonianWorkshops/binders/open_refine</a>.</p>
<h3 id='dbbrowser'>DB Browser for SQLite</h3>
<p>SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.  We
  use a simple database manager called <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
  in our lessons. We will use the <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a> program,
  which is available for all major platforms.</p>
<h3 id='rstudio'>RStudio</h3>
